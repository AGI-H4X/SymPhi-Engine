# SymPhi-Engine
Physics-aware symbolic implication kernel for modular, self-improving AI. Features Python modules (symphi_framework.py, symphi_core_engine.py) for alphabet symmetry classification, energy computation, vectorization, and implication engine. README covers conserved-energy grammar, DCG topology, and applications in reasoning/cryptography.
