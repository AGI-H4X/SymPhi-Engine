# SymPhi-Engine

Physics-aware symbolic implication kernel for modular, self-improving AI. Applies conserved-energy grammar to alphabet symmetries for stable transformations in reasoning and cryptography.

## Features
- **Symmetry Classification**: Categorizes letters (A-Z/a-z) as idempotent, biphasic, involutive, or asymmetric.
- **Energy Computation**: Assigns/validates energies preserving totals (e.g., \(E(\text{FWEM}) \approx 42.04\)).
- **Vectorization**: Encodes symbols into 4D vectors for implication flows.
- **Implication Engine**: Reads words, transforms via morphisms, checks conservation.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AGI-H4X/SymPhi-Engine.git
cd SymPhi-Engine
pip install -e .
